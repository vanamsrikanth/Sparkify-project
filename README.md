### Building Customer Churn Predictive Model Using SPARK

This repository contains the results of the Data Science Nanodegree Sparkify Capstone Project. Itsâ€™s purpose is to give the reviewers access to the code. More information can be found on a [Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@vanamsrikanth/customer-churn-prediction-for-music-app-using-pyspark-4127c3c00c1f).

## Installation
  
    This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

    Python
    Spark
    Pyspark
    pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

You will also need to have software installed like Anaconda to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Motivation

#### developing Skills of:

- Loading large datasets into Spark and manipulating them using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes
- Using the machine learning APIs within Spark ML to build and tune models
- Integrating the skills I've learned in the Spark course and the Data Scientist Nanodegree program

## Files Description

- Sparkify.ipynb Notebook is main file of the project.
- It demonstrates the process of using pyspark to explore the data and build the model.

## Result
We Split the feature & target variable data set into train, test and then built pipeline and implemented 3 machine learning models.
Since the churned users are a fairly small subset, we used F1 score as the metric to optimize and we found GBTClassifier better model compared to other One.

I post a blog about the detail, you can find it [here](https://medium.com/@vanamsrikanth/customer-churn-prediction-for-music-app-using-pyspark-4127c3c00c1f).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Udacity for the project. And  instructions in the notebook are also well prepared by Udacity team.
